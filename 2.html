<h2>2018년 12월 27일 소식</h2>
<img src="xxx.jpg"><p><a href="http://beastsandnatives.com/" target="_blank" title="XXX-language">XXX의 [Language]</a>가 Pitchfork에서 <strong><u>7.2</u></strong>점을 수상하였다. 이하는 일부이다.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">On their debut album Language, XXX present themselves as the alternative to the sanitized, hyper-glossy rap music typically pumped out by the billion-dollar Korean music industry. If BTS are measured and subtle about their politics, XXX cuss in two different languages to get the point across. Kim launches invectives against the corporate K-pop machine, money-thirsty rappers, and oppressive standards of “success” (as defined by capitalism). He’s at his best when he’s absolutely seething with rage—a refreshing mode of delivery that doesn’t appear often in K-pop’s biggest hits.</p></body></html>
